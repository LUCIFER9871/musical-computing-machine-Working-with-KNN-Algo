K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method, meaning it does not assume any underlying data distribution and makes predictions based on the similarity between data points.
KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression.

## How It Works:
Choose the number of neighbors (K).
Calculate the distance between the test point and all training points.
Select the K nearest neighbors.
Assign the majority class (for classification).

KNN is:A lazy learning algorithm (no explicit training phase).Sensitive to feature scaling.Simple yet powerful for small-to-medium datasets.
